# frontend_exam

Hello developer! See below for the task breakdown as well as some useful links and documentation for running the project. Most (if not all) of your work will go into the src/components/ExamComponent.vue file. Good luck!

## Folder structure

design: PNG image of the form your component will take
public: Some static assets
src: The source code for the project
...configuration files

## Task

### Primary task *75% important*

* Add the HTML and CSS required to make ExamComponent.vue render as depicted in the design files (mobile + desktop).

### Secondary task *25% important*

* Leverage Vue's reactivity model to bind the form's inputs to the component's local state
